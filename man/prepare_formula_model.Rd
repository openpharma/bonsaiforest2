\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing all the necessary variables.}

\item{response_formula_str}{A character string for the response part, e.g.,
"outcome ~ trt", for count models "n_events + offset(log(days)) ~ trt" or for
survival models "Surv(time,status) ~ trt".}

\item{shrunk_predictive_formula_str}{Predictive terms to be shrunk ('shpredeffect').
These are typically interactions with the treatment variable. Can use either
interaction notation (e.g., "~ trt:subgroup") or random effects notation (e.g.,
"~ (trt || subgroup)"). Only one syntax form may be used across all formulas.}

\item{unshrunk_prognostic_formula_str}{Prognostic terms not to be shrunk
('unprogeffect'). These are main effects assumed to be important.}

\item{unshrunk_predictive_formula_str}{Predictive terms not to be shrunk
('unpredeffect'). Can use either interaction notation or random effects notation,
but only one syntax form across all formulas.}

\item{shrunk_prognostic_formula_str}{Prognostic terms to be shrunk
('shprogeffect'). These are main effects where regularization is desired.}

\item{response_type}{The type of outcome variable. One of "binary", "count",
"continuous", or "survival".}

\item{stratification_formula_str}{A formula string specifying the stratification
variable, e.g., "~ strata_var".}
}
\value{
A list with three elements: `formula` (a `brmsformula` object),
  `data` (the modified data.frame), and `response_type` (the
  character string of the response type).
}
\description{
This function serves as a powerful pre-processor for building complex Bayesian
models with the `brms` package. It automates the construction of a multi-part,
non-linear formula by classifying covariates into four distinct categories:
unshrunk prognostic, shrunk prognostic, unshrunk predictive, and shrunk predictive.
}
\details{
This classification allows for applying differential shrinkage (regularization)
to different parts of the model. The function also prepares the corresponding
data using R's contrast coding system for proper factor handling and interactions.

\section{Key Features}{

\itemize{
  \item \strong{Multi-Part Formula Construction:} It generates a `brmsformula`
    object with up to four distinct linear components (`unprogeffect`,
    `shprogeffect`, `unpredeffect`, `shpredeffect`), which are combined
    in a non-linear model. This allows for assigning different priors to each
    component.
  \item \strong{Automated Interaction Handling:} Predictive terms support two syntaxes:
    interaction notation (e.g., `~ trt:subgroup`) or random effects notation (e.g.,
    `~ (trt || subgroup)`). Note: only one syntax form (`:` or `||`) may be used
    across all predictive formula strings. All variables involved in interactions are
    converted to factors with treatment contrasts (reference coding), enabling proper
    model fitting and prediction on new data without manual dummy variable creation.
  \item \strong{Hierarchical Integrity:} When a predictive term like
    `trt:subgroup` is specified, the function automatically ensures that the
    corresponding prognostic (main) effect `subgroup` is included in the model,
    adhering to the principle of model hierarchy.
  \item \strong{Intelligent Defaults:} The main treatment variable is automatically
    added as an unshrunk prognostic term if not specified elsewhere. It also
    provides warnings and resolves overlaps if a term is accidentally specified
    in multiple categories.
}
}

\section{Survival Model Details (Robust Spline Knot Calculation)}{

For survival models (`response_type = "survival"`), the function explicitly models
the baseline hazard using B-splines via `brms::bhaz()`. It implements a highly
robust method for calculating spline knots to ensure stability:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{Boundary Definition:} It first establishes boundary knots by taking
    the range of unique event times and adding a small buffer. This creates a
    "safe" interval for placing internal knots.
  \item \strong{Internal Knot Placement:} It calculates internal knots using
    quantiles of the event times that fall strictly within the boundary knots.
    This prevents knots from being placed at the exact edges of the data, which
    can cause numerical instability.
  \item \strong{Fallback for Sparse Data:} If there are too few unique event
    times to calculate quantile-based knots, it gracefully falls back to placing
    evenly spaced knots within the defined boundaries.
}
}

\section{Data Transformation}{

It is critical to note that this function returns a modified `data.frame`.
The treatment variable and any variables involved in interactions are converted
to factors with treatment contrasts (reference coding). This contrast-based
approach enables proper model fitting and easy prediction on new data, as the
same contrasts are automatically applied. The returned `data` object should be
used in the subsequent call to `brms::brm()`, not the original data.
}

\section{Stratification}{

The `stratification_formula_str` argument allows for estimating certain parameters
separately for different groups. Its behavior depends on the `response_type`:
\itemize{
  \item \code{survival}: Estimates a separate baseline hazard function (`bhaz`) for
    each level of the stratification variable.
  \item \code{continuous}: Models the residual standard deviation (`sigma`) as varying
    across levels of the stratification variable.
  \item \code{count}: Models the overdispersion parameter (`shape`) as varying
    across levels of the stratification variable.
