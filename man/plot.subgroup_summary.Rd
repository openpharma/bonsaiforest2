\title{Plot Marginal Subgroup Treatment Effects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{subgroup_summary}(x, x_lab = NULL, title = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{subgroup_summary} or \code{list}. Object created by \code{summary_subgroup_effects()},
or a named list of such objects for comparison plots.}

\item{x_lab}{\code{character(1)} or \code{NULL}. Custom label for x-axis.}

\item{title}{\code{character(1)} or \code{NULL}. Custom title for plot.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
\code{ggplot}. Forest plot visualization of subgroup treatment effects.
}
\description{
Creates a forest plot from a \code{subgroup_summary} object or list of objects.
}
\details{
This function creates forest plots for subgroup treatment effects. It supports two modes:

\strong{Single Model Plot}: When \code{x} is a single \code{subgroup_summary} object, creates a
traditional forest plot with estimates and confidence intervals displayed as text.

\strong{Multiple Model Comparison}: When \code{x} is a named list of \code{subgroup_summary} objects,
creates a comparative plot where different models are distinguished by colors and shapes.
This is useful for comparing OVAT vs global models, different prior specifications, or
sensitivity analyses.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Single model plot
summary1 <- summary_subgroup_effects(brms_fit = model1)
plot(summary1, title = "Subgroup Effects")

# Multiple model comparison
summary2 <- summary_subgroup_effects(brms_fit = model2)
comparison <- list(
  "Model 1" = summary1,
  "Model 2" = summary2
)
plot(comparison, title = "Model Comparison")
