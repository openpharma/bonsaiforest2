Description: An extension of the 'bonsaiforest' package that provides 
    increased flexibility in prior selection and modeling options. It 
    supports four types of endpoints and simplifies the fitting and 
    interpretation of Bayesian models for subgroup analysis. Leveraging 
    'brms', it distinguishes between prognostic and predictive factors 
    using differential shrinkage priors and generates publication-ready 
    forest plots.
