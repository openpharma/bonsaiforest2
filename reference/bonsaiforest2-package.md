# bonsaiforest2: Flexible Bayesian Shrinkage Based Forest Plots

An extension of the 'bonsaiforest' package that provides increased
flexibility in prior selection and modeling options. It supports four
types of endpoints and simplifies the fitting and interpretation of
Bayesian models for subgroup analysis. Leveraging 'brms', it
distinguishes between prognostic and predictive factors using
differential shrinkage priors and generates publication-ready forest
plots.
